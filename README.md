# Pairs-Trading-Algorithm

## Description

This is a basic implementation of a statistical arbitrage strategy using pairs trading, where the algorithm identifies and trades co-integrated stock pairs to exploit temporary deviations in their price spread. It fetches historical stock data, identifies cointegrated pairs, and simulates trades based on a mean-reverting strategy.

## Features

- Historical data retrieval using yfinance.
- Cointegration analysis with statistical testing.
- Z-score based trading signal generation.
- Backtesting with performance metrics.
- Visualization of trading signals, spread, and cumulative returns
